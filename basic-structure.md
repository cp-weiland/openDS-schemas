title: Basic structure of openDS json schemas

## Introduction
This page explains the basic structure of the json schema for an open Digital Specimen. Specifically, it explains what is needed to:

- link schema properties to the relevant controlled vocabularies, to make open Digital Specimens machine-readable;
- make the schema [schema.org](https://schema.org/) compliant, including where necessary relevant types and properties from [bioschemas.org](https://bioschemas.org/);


## Starting the schema


```json
{
 "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema",
 "$id": "https://nsidr.org/schemas/opendsschema.json", / needs to be a DOI for the type definition based on this schema /
 "title": "OpenDigitalSpecimen",
 "description": "JSON schema for an open Digital Specimen, version 0.1",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
   "id",
   "modified",
   "midsLevel",
   "physicalSpecimenId",
   "institution",
   "name"
  ],
  "properties": { ... ... } 
}
```

## Context of the schema
openDS needs a JSON-LD context to establish all the contexts (namespaces) needed to provide machine-readable digital specimens. These contexts include basic terms from Dublin Core, Schema.org, bioschemas.org as well as more specific terms from bio- and geodiversity sources e.g., Darwin Core, ABCD/EFG, etc.

To avoid unnecessary complexity openDS does not import the complete [JSON-LD context file](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-rc/blob/master/context.jsonld). openDS copies and uses only the needed contexts. This is simpler and easier to understand.

For Darwin Core, do we use the ```dwc:``` namespace or the ```dwciri:``` namespace? It depends on whether a property has a literal/numeric value or a uri reference. As in the case of institution, which has code part as a literal and the referent as an iri. So both are needed.

```json
"@context": {
    "abcd": "http://rs.tdwg.org/abcd/terms/",
    "abcd-efg": "http://rs.tdwg.org/abcd-efg/terms/",
    "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
    "dwc": "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/",
    "dwciri": "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/iri/",
    "schema": "http://schema.org/"
}
```

Note to self: What do we have to do to make an open digital specimen recognisable as a [Thing](https://schema.org/Thing) under schema.org? Do we need to define a new type there? Or is it a sub-type of CreativeWork/Dataset? There isn't anything under bioschemas.org that corresponds. But we couldn't do it under bioschemas because we need a DS that extends beyond life sciences to include geo scope as well. DS is an entirely new kind of (FAIR) digital object, which are not fully recognised under schema.org yet. Thus best to do it as a new kind of Thing. I think this would be compatible with OBO ontologies too, where we end up with Digital Specimen being a kind of Information Content Entity, which I believe is a Thing as well.

## Overall structure, top-level

The A section is represented by an a_section object containing all the key/value pair properties that are deemed to be authoritative information. The definition of the A section corresponds to the information elements expected to be present at MIDS level 2.

The S section is represented by an s_section object, which itself may contain multiple objects grouping specific kinds of supplementary information (such as external links) together. The definition of the S section corresponds to the additional information elements expected to be present at MIDS level 3 and more.


```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "title": "OpenDigitalSpecimen",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      <etc. etc. "autoGeneratedField": "handle“>
      <and other preliminary elements>
    },

    "a_section": {
      "$id": "#/properties/a_section",
      "title": “Authoritative information section",
      "physicalSpecimenId": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Physical specimen identifier“ },
      "$comment": "insert more a_section information elements here",
    }, 

    "s_section": {
      "$id": "#/properties/s_section",
      "title": "Supplementary information section",
      "type": "array",
      "externallinks": {
        <object of type array for links> },
      "$comment": "insert more s_section objects/variables here",
    },  
       … <other similar section definitions> …
  }
}

```

## Authoritative a_section information elements
Definitions of individual information elements belonging to the authoritative a_section follow. Each definition is a key/value pair.

### Id

### ModifiedOn


### MIDSLevel

### PhysicalSpecimenId

*Each definition should also contain the corresponding context definition perhaps?*

An identifier for the physical specimen within a collection. May or may not be unique. Examples: physical specimen identifier, barcode, catalog number, etc.

Equivalences: dwc:catalogNumber, abcd:numericUnitID, abcd:physicalObjectId

Required: Yes
Repeatable: Yes
Cardinality: 1..n

Context:

```json
"@context": {
          "physicalSpecimenId": "http://rs.tdwg.org/abcd/terms/numericUnitID"

          "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/catalogNumber"
          "http://rs.tdwg.org/abcd/terms/physicalObjectID"
}



```


### Institution

### MaterialType

### Name


## Supplementary s_section information elements
Definitions of individual information elements belonging to the supplementary s_section follow. Each definition is a key/value pair.
